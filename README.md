# MarketPlace_Markade
KB_Markade is an online resale platform where users can bid on products listed by sellers.
It features distinct interfaces for the three stakeholders,  sellers, buyers, and an admin. Sellers manage their products and bids, buyers browse, filter, and bid on items, while the admin finally approves of the reselling of an item, thus, overseeing the entire platform.
